      <p className='about'> Hi, my name is <b>Melyn Atieno Were.</b>
        Currently, I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Financial Economics but I have always had a passion for tech
        and this made me join a Bootcamp to learn Software Engineering. I enjoyed the experience
        and I look forward to progressing in my career as a Software Engineer. <br/>
        I really enjoy solving complex problems and I love how I can use technology to solve problems. I 
        consider myself as someone who is self-driven, passionate about technology, a fast learner, a good
        collaborator and a good leader.
